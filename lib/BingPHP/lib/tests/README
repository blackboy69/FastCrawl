README FOR BING SDK for PHP UNIT TESTS
======================================

The library's functionality tests require a valid AppId from Bing in order to 
run. You can obtain an AppId directly from the Bing Developer website at 
http://www.bing.com/developer/.

Installing the AppID
====================

In order to make the test suite recognize the App ID, you need to follow these 
steps:

1. Copy appid.php.template to appid.php
2. Replace the words "YOUR APPID HERE" with the App ID provided by Bing


Running the Tests
=================

The test suite is designed to be run using PHPUnit (http://phpunit.de/) 
version 3.4.9 or higher.
