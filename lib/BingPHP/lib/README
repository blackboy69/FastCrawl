BING SDK FOR PHP README
=======================

Welcome! This is the Bing SDK for PHP, a toolkit that allows you to
easily use Bing's API to fetch search results and use in your own application. 

A complete class hierarchy and reference is available in the docs directory
in HTML format


Directory Structure
===================

The following directories are included in the library:

	- Msft
	  Contains the actual source for the SDK
	
	- docs
	  Contains the autogenerated HTML reference for the SDK's classes
	
	- tests
	  Contains the unit tests for the SDK


Class Inclusion
===============

In order to use the SDK in your project, you need to include the following
files:

	- Msft/Exception.php
	- Msft/Bing/Exception.php
	- Msft/Bing/Search/Exception.php
	- Msft/Bing/Search.php


Usage
=====

    Code Example 1
    ==============
    $o = new Msft_Bing_Search($myBingAPPID);
    $o->setQuery('Microsoft')
      ->setWebCount(10)
      ->setSource('Web');
    
    $raw    = $o->search();
    $result = json_decode($raw);
    foreach($result->SearchResponse->Web->Results as $value) {
        printf('<a href="%s">%s</a><br />',$value->Url,$value->Title);
    }

The Bing SDK for PHP is designed to give PHP developers an object-oriented
interface to access the Bing API.

The Bing SDK supports fluent interfaces in PHP so that options can be easily
chained together for readability.

The heart of the SDK is the Msft_Bing_Search class. It supports all of the
options available for searching web and images that are defined in the API.

The API docs give complete details on the methods and parameters.

As you can see from the example above, using the SDK is as simple as
instantiating the class, setting the required parameters and calling the
search() method. Because most parameters have logical defaults, the only
required parameter is the query to execute. 

    Code Example 2
    ==============
    $o = new Msft_Bing_Search($myBingAPPID);
    $o->setQuery('Microsoft');
    $raw = $o->search();

Code Example 2 demonstrates the minimum required to execute a search query.

The other required parameter, passed into the constructor, is your Bing APP ID. 
Each application with which you use the SDK will need its own APP ID. You can get
your APP ID from Microsoft by going to the web page
http://www.bing.com/developers/createapp.aspx

Once you have it, store it in your confirugation file somewhere and use it
everytime you connect to the Bing API.

There is one extra feature in the SDK that is not in the API itself.

First, you have the option of limiting the search to a specific site. You can
do this of course by simply starting your query with "site: example.com".
However, an easier way to do it is to use the setSite('example.com') and let
the SDK do it for you.
